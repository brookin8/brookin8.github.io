So what's this blog about?

To be honest, nothing that isn't already covered in hundreds of other blogs. 

I'm currently on a personal journey towards becoming a developer, and am going to be recording and flushing out everything I learn here.

The only thing that makes this blog different is that, well, it's mine. 

I will be describing all of the concepts and tools in a way that makes sense to my brain - that is simple, broad strokes, and as a smaller piece in the overall larger puzzle.  

Everybody learns and understands things differently, and hopefully this can be an additional resource for the other folks out there who happen to learn the same way I do.
